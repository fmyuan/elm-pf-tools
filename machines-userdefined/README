## Purposes
**This is for hacking machine files of CLM 4.5. It's supposed to be used TOGETHER with either of two python scripts:**

``` 
runPTCLM.py - for point-mode CLM

or,

runGRDCLM.py - for global-mode CLM

```

## HOW to USE
There are 3 sets of machine files for using on 3 platforms:

 (1) *.Darwin_gnu -- for using on mac osx, user-defined gnu compilers;
 
 (2) *.LINUX_gnu -- for using on OIC, with built-in gnu compilers under:
```
 /projects/cesm/devtools/
```

 (3) *.LINUX2_gnu -- for using on CADES (OR-CONDO), with built-in gnu-based NETCDF4 under:
 ```
  /software/user_tools/current/cades-ccsi/netcdf4/4.4.0/openmpi-1.1-gcc-5.3
 ```
 
 **NOTE:**
 
 Each set of machine files includes 3:
 ```
 env_mach_specific.*
 Macros.*
 mkbatch.*
 ```
