To complile on CADES:
make all

To run:
sbatch makezone.pbs

(1)You may need to change the directory in the pbs script.

(2) you will need to create the following directory: 
/lustre/or-hydra/cades-ccsi/proj-shared/project_acme/ACME_inputdata/atm/datm7/$FORCDIR/cpl_bypass_full
where $FORCDIR is the path containing the datm files you want to convert.

(3) prior to compile, make sure you have needed metdata and its domain file under $FORCDIR.
AND ALSO modify those in source code 'makezones_reanalysis.f90'.
